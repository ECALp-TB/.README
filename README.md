### GitHub Getting Started

Before anything, visit https://docs.github.com/en/get-started

### This Organization is to be used for the coordination of ECALp-TB analysis tools

Repositories will be created under demand (ask the admins) and should be used by analyzers/developpers to software development and version control, allowing developers to store and manage their code publicly available for all analyzers.


### Example of pull-request procedure

The way to proceed is:

    Go to https://github.com/ECALp-TB/TheRepositoryYouWant and click on the right-up button saying: Fork. Choose to fork the repository in your own user space.

    In your local machine, clone the repository:
    git clone git@github.com:ECALp-TB/TheRepositoryYouWant.git WhateverFolderName

    Make all the changes that you want (copy them from your private copy of the code that you use for your analysis. 
    
    commit and push your changes... to your own github repository (not to ECALp-TB/TheRepositoryYouWant !!)

    Go back to https://github.com/ECALp-TB/TheRepositoryYouWant and click on "New Pull Request" and follow the procedure.

The admins and assigned reviewers will review the request and see what is conflicting the changes already done and what is new.
